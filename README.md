**ERP System – Flask + Docker**

🚀 Overview
A modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) prototype built using Flask and containerized with Docker.
This system demonstrates structured backend architecture, modular UI routing, and production-ready container deployment — designed to simulate core ERP modules like HR Management and CRM.
Built with scalability and deployment-readiness in mind.

🧠 Problem Statement
Small and medium organizations often lack lightweight, customizable ERP systems.
This project explores how a modular ERP foundation can be built using minimal infrastructure and deployed consistently using Docker.

🏗️ Architecture
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Jinja templating)
Containerization: Docker
Version Control: Git + GitHub
Deployment Ready: Runs via Docker container
